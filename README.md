  **Introduction.**
  
        This is our report for the Micro Controller Final Project for IA 2209 – Microcontroller Laboratory. We are 5 Team members in A team. By doing this project we have a great understanding of the ATmega 328p Micro Controller and How To Program It. 
 
  **Objectives (Tasks) of the project.**
          
   Task 1: Count Up and Count Down • Build a circuit that allows counting up and counting down using two push buttons. Each button press should increment or decrement the count value, respectively. The count should 
   range from 0 to 9. 
 
   Task 2: Seven-Segment Display • Connect the seven-segment display to the microcontroller and design a program to display the count value on it. Ensure that the display accurately represents the count 
   from 0 to 9. 
 
   Task 3: Binary Value Indication • Extend the previous circuit to display the binary representation of the count value using 4 LEDs. • Each LED should represent one bit of the count value, with the least 
   significant bit (LSB) on the rightmost LED. Update the LEDs whenever the count changes. 
 
   Task 4: Brightness Control • Incorporate a separate LED that changes brightness according to the count value. As the count increases, the LED's brightness should increase proportionally. Implement a suitable 
   method (e.g., pulse width modulation - PWM) to control the LED's brightness based on the count value. 
 
   Task 5: Mode Changing • Add a push button to toggle between different output modes. When this button is pressed, the circuit should cycle through the following modes: displaying the count value on the seven- 
   segment display, indicating the binary value on the 4 LEDs, and adjusting the brightness of the fifth LED. Each press of the button should switch to the next mode.
